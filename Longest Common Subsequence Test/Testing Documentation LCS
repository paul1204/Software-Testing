Testing Documentation for Longest Common Subsequence Algorithm using a Control Flow Graph
O(n^2) Time Complexity

Nodes 1 through 7 has a runtime of O(n^2)
Nodes 8 through 12 ..			   O(n)

To reduce text on Control Flow Graph, some edges will represent a key, while the value will be listed in this documentation


//All Def Uses Definitions will be here,
//Where a is equal to the number
def(a)
use(a)

//To Represent Types
String x;
String y;
int n;
int[][] opt;
int i, j;
String lcs;

//Shortcuts
// n++ is the same as n = (n + 1)



def(1) = {x,y,m,n,opt}
use(1) = {m,n}

def(2) = {i}

use(3) = {i,m}

def(4) = {j}

use(5) = {j,n}


Node 6 represents the Root of a Decision Tree
If 6 returns Boolean Value 1, then 6a is executed
If 6 returns Boolean Value 0, then 6b is executed
*We use j twice in each Conditional Branch
*One for key value, other for changing value of the key
*# is to represent a key

use(6) = {x,y,i,j}

def(6a) = {opt[#][#], j}
use(6a) = {opt,i,j}

def(6b) = {opt[#][#], j}
use(6b) = {opt,i,j}

Node 7 represents a Transistion from the inner loop to the outer loop by changing index value of the outer loop
//def(7) = {i}
use(7) = {i}

**Refreshing i and j
def(8) = {lcs, i , j}

use(9) = {i,j,m,n}

Node 10 represents a Root for the Decision Tree

def(10a) = {lcs,i,j}
use(10a) = {x,y,i,j}

def(10b) = {i}
use(10b) = {opt, i,j}

def(10c) = {j}
use(10c) = {j}

Node 11 represents an organized way for the Decision Tree to loop back to Decision Tree Root

Node 12 (Accept State)
use(12) = {lcs}
