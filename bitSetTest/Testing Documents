- Base Choice -

Characteristics and Test Requirements 
C1 - "Constructor" does not throw NegativeArraySizeException (T/F)
C2 - "Set" is performed by negating boolean value 0 of specified bit and does not throw IndexOutOfBoundsException (T/F)
C3 - "Get" returns boolean value of bit and does not throw IndexOutOfBoundsException (T/F)
C4 - "Flip" negates boolean value of specified bit and does not throw IndexOutOfBoundsException (T/F)

Notes *
To reduce redundant code, @BeforeEach will be C1 and C2 T,T for each testing method unless testing False.

subTest0 is an extra testing branch of the negation methods. The test is exercising both sides of negation for further assurance. 

Test 4 is an unfesiable tests. During Runtime, if the Constructor has been passed a negative number, it will throw an Exception. In addition to that,
the state will be null and unable to negate a non null state thus causing Sequential Exceptions.

test5 may be redundant considering we exercised different False State of each Characteristic for each test
